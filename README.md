An ANN is the field of Artificial Intelligence,where it mimic the network of neurons
The ANN is designed by programming computers to behave simply like interconnected brain cells.
The dataset "Churn_modelling" is given in csv file format.
It is preprocessed,encoded the categorical data and the ANN model is built where the accuracy curve is plotted and results are predicted.
